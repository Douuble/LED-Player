# LED Player

## The Repository

This repository is where I record my first attempt at system design, which is a  light cube with a PC animation editor and an Android App controller.

## App
Developed an Android program using Java to control the player.

## Editor
Developed a PC-side animation editor using Java  to realize frame editing of 3-D animation.

## Hardware
• Used EasyEDA to design the PCB for the LED lights.
• Used C++ to complete functionalities of SoC serial communication, WiFi communication, LCD liquid crystal display menu, ADC keyboard keys, 128-point FFT, lamp brightness control etc.
